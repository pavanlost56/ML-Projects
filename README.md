## 🧩 Project Overview

### 🏦 Credit Score Prediction

- **Objective:** Predict a customer's credit score rating (Good, Standard, Poor) based on personal and financial information.
- **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- **Dataset:** [Credit Score Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification)
- **Location:** `projects/Task-1-CreditScore-Prediction`

---

### ✍️ Handwritten Character Recognition

- **Objective:** Recognize handwritten English characters (A-Z) using deep learning.
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Dataset:** [EMNIST Dataset](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset)
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, classification report.
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- **Location:** `projects/Task-3-Handwritten-character-recognition`

---

### 🩺 Disease Prediction

- **Objective:** Predict diseases based on given symptoms.
- **Approach:** Multi-class classification using traditional ML algorithms.
- **Models:** Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest.
- **Dataset:** [Disease Symptom Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset)
- **Optional:** Interactive interface using Streamlit or Flask.
- **Location:** `projects/Task-4-Disease-prediction`
